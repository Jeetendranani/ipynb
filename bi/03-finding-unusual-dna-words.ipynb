    "The last time we have finished with counting the $k$-mers, that is, short subsequences of nucleotides in the DNA. Let us stick with Lambda phage because of its compact genome, and check some code we have used the last time. Remember, we were counting the pairs (words of length $k=2$) of the successive nucleotides in the genome and estimating the probability of encountering a particular word if we would arbitrarily draw a word from the sequence. We used relative frequency for estimated probability. We also said that dinucleotide CG, often written by CpG to differentiate it with a CG content, has some interesting biological meaning. Instead of observing all different words, let us concentrate on CpGs only.\n",

That is, for sure there is some random permutation of the Lambda phage genome where the number of CpGs is 3,113. Why random permutation? Ah, because the sequence we get by random permutation of the nucleotides has the same nucleotide counts as the original sequence, that is, comes from the equal multinomial distribution. And because the sequence that we get by a random permutation is random. If we would observe that in a randomly permuted sequence the number of CpGs is often around 3,113 or better, is usually higher than this number, that we could not claim that the number of CpGs in original sequence is anything special. In that case and concerning CpGs, the original sequence would not have any particular structure. It would be just as any random sequence."

    "Are 1,000 permutations enough? Perhaps. It would help us, though, to use more permutations. Say, 10,000. For Lambda phage this would work, but for bigger sequences we would need to optimize the code and use some parallel processing. Instead, though, we could still ask some statisticians and query them if there is some formal distribution that we could use instead of performing permutation experiments. Often, for simple hypothesis such as our one, this would work, but sometimes permutation experiments are all we could do.\n",
